# Cortana
 A fun project to be able to interact with ChatGPT with audio


## Installing
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Features

Here are the cool features I implemented:

- Markdown reader (by default, it's Mark text, you can change it for whatever you want)
- Multi-discussion (select any file you want)
- Voice and text (you can activate an inline discussion as if you were discussing with Cortana, ... however it's slow!)
- Prompt Image (using the command `Prompt image` and then asking for whatever you want is going to create images)


## Language

By default, the language is English, but you can use french as well. To do so, you have to add the extension of Sphinx for [french](https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/blob/master/reference/pocketsphinx.rst) into the appropriate folder: `speech_recognition\pocketsphinx-data\fr-FR`

## API key
You need to create a file `api_key.py` inside which you have `secret_ket` with the API provided in your openIA account.
