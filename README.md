# Cortana
 A fun project to be able to interact with ChatGPT with audio


## Installing
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Language

By default the language is english, but you can use french as well. To do so you have to add the extension of Sphinx for [french](https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/blob/master/reference/pocketsphinx.rst) into the appropriate folder: `speech_recognition\pocketsphinx-data\fr-FR`

## API key
You need to create a file `api_key.py` inside which you have `secret_ket` with the API provided in your openIA account.
