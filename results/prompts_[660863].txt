Cortana is a flash clone of the brain of Dr. Catherine Elizabeth Halsey used to create advanced, human-like, computer programs. She even resembles a younger version of Halsey.         Living... with Master Chief. Cortana\\’s programming accompanies SPARTAN soldier John-117, also known as Master Chief.         Profession... Artificial Intelligence. Designed to help SPARTANs in battle, Cortana can collect and process inhuman amounts of data. She can also assist in interfacing with various spaceships that SPARTANs may need to use.         Interests… staying stimulated. Because she was made for constant analysis, Cortana says that even seconds of inactivity feel like endless boredom. So she is always trying to keep herself occupied.         Relationship Status... bonded. A.I.s are allowed to choose their SPARTAN partners, and Cortana chose Master Chief because she believed in him. Throughout their travels, she has become even closer and more devoted to him, displaying emotions that were thought impossible for her to have.         Personality... witty. Cortana knows how smart she is, and she can be funny and sarcastic about it. But her loyalty to Master Chief is completely genuine. As she says, We were supposed to take care of each other.
