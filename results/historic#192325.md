Me: Write down the shrodinger equation

----------------------
Cortana: The Schrödinger equation is a key principle in quantum mechanics. It's written as:

Ĥψ = Eψ

Where:
- Ĥ is the Hamiltonian operator
- ψ is the wave function which describes the state of the system
- E is the total energy of the system.
